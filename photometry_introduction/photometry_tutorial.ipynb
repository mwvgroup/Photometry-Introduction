    "Unlike spectra, which classify the energy output of a single object per wavelength, photometric observations are images taken of multiple objects over a range of wavelengths. In many ways photometric images are similar to pictures taken with a black and white camera. You can think of the image as a collection of pixels, each of which has some numeric value that describes how much light reached that particular point of the camera's sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photometric images can be taken over a variety of wavelength ranges. These wavelength ranges are referred to as ***bands***, and have standardized letter names. For example, H-band goes from 1.5 to 1.8 micrometers. To observe in a particular band, a telescope observer will use a filter that only lets light within the band pass through the telescope. After light has passed through the filter, the optics in the telescope guide the light onto a CCD sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, this sensor is much the same as those found in a common digital camera, and is broken up into a grid of pixels. When a photon hits a pixel, it releases an electron. By counting the number of electrons in each pixel, we can determine the number of photons that landed at that part of the sensor. This value is typically recorded either in units of total photon counts or as photon counts per second. However, sometimes images are converted into other units, like ergs or nanomaggies. Be careful of the units, don't assume!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that in a photometric image, pixels don't represent color values. Instead they represent a number of photons (possibly per second). Color can be added to the image after the fact, but in this notebook, we are only concerned with the numerical data.\n"

    "Before talking about aperture photometry, we need to understand the ***point spread function***, also called the **PSF**.\n",

    "Objects tend to become \"spread out\" and larger on a photometric image. This is caused by a combination of influences including imperfections in the telescope optics and various effects within the CCD. A sensible question to ask is how much a point source - such as a distant star - is spread out on an image. The answer to this question is the PSF. In fact, an apt definition for the point spread function is *\"a function that describes how an imaging system represents a point source\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below is an example of a Gaussian PSF. Remember that the tail ends of a Gaussian never actually reach zero, but instead go on forever. Take a moment to think about how this effects a photometric image (before I answer the question below).\n"

Even though most of the light from a star is focused around a single point in an image, it is impossible to draw a circle around that star on an image and say \"this is all of the light from that star\". No matter how big we make that circle, there will always be light that falls outside of it on the image.\n"

    "Aperture photometry is a process where we determine the energy output of an object by analyzing photometric images. Pretend you are observing an object with a telescope and imagine a sphere surrounding the object you’re looking at. Also, imagine that this sphere has a radius that is the same as your distance from the object, so that you are on the surface of this sphere. The collection area of your telescope only covers a small portion of the surface area of the sphere. If we assume that the object emits photons evenly in all directions, we can then determine the total photon emissions of the object as\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ \\ \\ \\ Total\\ Photon\\ Counts = \\frac{Observed\\ Counts\\ from\\ Object}{Collection\\ Area} * Total\\ Area\\ of\\ Sphere = \\frac{Counts\\ Observed\\ from\\ Object}{Collection\\ Area} * \\pi r^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r$ is the radius of the imaginary sphere, or equivalently, your distance from the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know how far away we are from an object, then the only information missing from the above equation is the photon counts we observed from an object. In order to find this value we use photometric images. In essence, we begin by drawing an aperture around the object in an image. We then count the number of photons that fell within the aperture, also known as the ***aperture sum***.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to remember that the aperture sum is not the same as the total observed photon counts. Remember that because of the PSF, we can never create an aperture that contains the entire object. Instead we settle on creating an aperture that contains most of the object in the image. But we have to be careful. Too small of an aperture means you might not be including enough of the object you’re interested in. However, too large an aperture means your including more background noise and possibly even another object. In general, the aperture size you use will depend on the type of object you want to look at and the PSF of the images themselves.\n"
